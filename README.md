# 🎬 IMDb Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis using Simple RNN 

This project demonstrates the use of a Simple **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** to analyze the sentiment of IMDb movie reviews — classifying them as **Positive** or **Negative**.

It leverages TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the deep learning model, and uses preprocessed data directly from the IMDb dataset. This is a great starting point for anyone exploring Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Recurrent Neural Networks.
